                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>I started this conversation with ChatGPT (version 3), about 3 weeks ago and since then have refined
                    my questions trying to get a possible way to change the current political system. Why? you may ask.
                    Well, I think that everybody could agree that although the system seems "OK" it’s not really very
                    good. So, I decided to use AI (artificial intelligence) as a means to solve this problem.</p>
                <p>My Question: I would like to replace MP's (members of parliament) with AI (artificial intelligence)
                    what would be the scenario for this? </p>
                <p>ChatGPT: Replacing members of parliament with AI would certainly be a significant change to our
                    political system, and could have both positive and negative consequences.</p>
                <p>Then after more conversation I managed to get to the core of what is needed. I do not hazve the
                    expertise for this, but I have some time on my hands so I thought I would give it a go!</p>
